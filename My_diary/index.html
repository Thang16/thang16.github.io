            <br>
              At this time, while most people are asleep or at least, preparing to go to sleep, <br>us University students don’t usually have that luxury. Maybe that’s just a fancy excuse for us owls fooling people into thinking we always work our asses off 24/7 to snatch HD’s. Well at least that's what we all want and try to achieve...
                <br><br>
                Anyway, during this serene and high concentrated time, I often take my studying seriously, by saying that I mean really pick up a pen and start my homework, stop watching YouTube and procrastinating because I need to show something in class at 9 am tomorrow and it’s 12 am so...
            <br>

              I don’t know if it’s just me, but inspiration FLOWS at this time. My brain just doesn’t work before 1 am (or at least that’s how I believe), but that’s not the same story for my other senses. After you’ve had such a long day and you still force yourself to functions, every organ seems to be put into idle mode and that’s not so good for my previous semesters when I was doing craft and typesetting most of the time, especially when I had to take control of hands and eyes for percision.
                <br><br>
                Now this brings me back to those glorious days. I used to cut many sheets of paper for my packaging and publication with insane precision using my bare hands (obviously) and a blunt knife because I always forget and sometimes too lazy to go to the bookstore for new blades. Anyway, since I picked digital-based subjects, I only need a conscious mind and a pair of working eyes.

              This is usually my getting ready to sleep time. I can’t keep doing anything during this time when my brain starts to shut down, it doesn’t matter if I haven’t finished my projects anymore. But again, I can’t just go from studying to sleep immediately, I have to do it the usual way, watch something or read something before doing the next thing. Maybe I’ve watched too much Rupaul’s for the day so let’s move on to something less extravagant, something gets me sleepy quick. 
                <br><br>
                Ancient Aliens clips from YouTube used to do the trick very well since they’re all pretty much the same, telling assumptions of how various cultures worship the same trio gods and they all come from the sky and they all leave Earth the same way. But these days I tend to browse news websites and read a few things that catch my attention, mostly headings and captions, I never like lengthy articles and they sure can’t get me sleepy.

            <br>
              I bet I’m not the only one who still stick their eyes to their phone while lying on bed with lights off. Especially when I still have a significant bond with my hometown and at his time, it’s only 11 pm there, things are just starting to get fun. Still, this is late as hell, and I know for sure I can’t get enough sleep if I keep doing this. Let’s just hope I get sleepy in no time.
                <br><br>
                Butttt, there are new scandals. Love Drama. Sometimes my crazy friends even want to call me at this hour, even though they know it's dead late here. Those are usually short conversations, but still, short conversations for us are 30 minutes at least. Things lead to to things, after an hour or so we're still talking, this time spilling tea about people we hate.

              Ok this is really late y’all should be sleeping, not browsing stuff from the Internet. That's really bad for your health and you won't have a conscious day tomorrow ,trust me. Let's turn off our devices and fall asleep.

              This is still pretty early for most people to be getting up but this period is usually when I wake up to catch a flight back home. I always wasn’t abl to sleep properly the night before the flight so it is not exactly getting up, more like pushing myself out of bed and have some minor last preparation for an eight-hour flight. The suns hasn’t showed up at this time just yet especially during the summer, but I think this is the best time to be awake. 
                <br><br>
                I’m much more conscious at this time than at 10 or 11 am and maybe that’s a good thing because I can make sure I don’t forget anything for the flight but also not so good for usual days because well, I never wake up before 7 so I always forget something. It’s still so cold around this time but well, since I’m going to a tropical country, I don’t give a freak about being warm anymore. Finally, I’ll be warm for the next few months.

              I used to wake up around this time when I was in high school because it started at 7:15 am! You should feel blessed my Aussie friends for not studying an Asian country. I still rememeber my dad had to wake me up all the time becuase he knew damn well I would turn off the alarm 0.5s after it rang and kept sleeping like nothing happened. 
                <br><br>
                But anyway, that was hellata good time of my life when the stress level was always maintained, and you don’t have to worry about cooking and cleaning for yourself all the time *sobbing* 6 am in Australia for me is still pretty serene and quiet maybe because I live in a quiet suburb but still, when compared to my hometown, Vietnam, it is a totally different story. Millions of motorcycles roaring on tiny streets echoing to my very own room... memories...

            <br>
              Finally, this is when I (officially) force myself to get out of bed for work after 30 minutes of disruptive alarms ringing 15cm from my ears. My morning routine is pretty simple though, brush teeth, brush my teeth retainer, cleanse my face, eat cereal, get dress (duh), apply vitamin C, and finally sunscreen. I have always had this superstition and that is good skin gets me to places. 
                <br><br>
                It wasn’t just me but many people think the same way too, radiant and flawless skin acts as a fancy mask for when you meet people and more importantly, it stands for a refined personality, and in the realm of design, that is important. I also learnt about human’s metabolism acting its best when you have breakfast from 7 to 9 am so that’s recently been my encouragement for getting up early. But other than working days, there is no way I’m out of bed at this time, no matter how good the scientific facts are.

              I call this the hour of public transport. Most people would be commuting to work during this rush hour if they start work at 9 which means the majority of people. It’s funny how they call it rush hour but you just can’t rush anyway. You have to wait for the bus, then wait for the train if you don’t own a car like me, then you have to stand or sit amongst thousands of strangers tiredly waiting for their station. 
                <br><br>
                But somehow I find this whole commuting using public transport a peaceful thing since we don’t have to stay focus and drive or avoid jerks on the roads, instead we read books, listen to music, chat with our friends from different time zones. It is also the only time of day when my brain isn’t turned on at its fullest so I’m care free and sometimes I imagine myself in a fantasy that is never going to happen. That’s healthy for my mind actually.

            <br>
              I have no class starting at 9 am this semester so I would be recalling my memory from last semester, one of my most glorious semester ever. It was a studio class and most of the time the briefs were quite open so I shaped them into my advantage all the time, which is print and crafty stuff. I still remember how shook my friends were when I took the embossed packaging out of my bag, wrapped in maroon ribbons and sometimes I sprayed some fragrance on them, because I’m what? Sickening! 
                <br><br>
                But Uriah, if you are reading this, that doesn’t mean I don’t enjoy web and digital-based things :)), it’s just I’ve done so much print and I’m quite experienced in it while web for me is extremely new and the time just hasn’t come. Still, it was pretty awesome around 9 am for me seeing how people liked my projects.

            <br>
              10 am is when things at work start to get serious. Most people in my place arrive pretty early at around 8:30 am, that’s also the official working hour but my colleagues in the branding department are the exceptions. They come at 9 - 9:30 so after a few chats and coffee and settling down, 10 am is when everyone gets their hands dirty. That’s also when you start receiving tons of emails and people walking to one another’s desk to ask where they saved their files, what the clients said about last week progress, etc etc... 
                <br><br>
                Since I’m the most amateur junior in this workplace, I often turn around and ask the senior designer a lot, A LOT from small things like default kerning they usually use, optical or metrics to important matters like should I include the legend from the plans or just get rid of it in the design manual. I think 10 am is a good time for my brain when its not too sleepy or too tired, just right.

              At 11 am Sarah, who sits next to me usually gets up from her desk to get some coffee and snack. I’m just like her, a big snacker. Also, after a few hours working and squinting your eyes to make sure everything looks great on screen, everyone seems to seek a bit of refreshment by chatting to one another for a moment, something like where to get lunch today, how one’s dog is doing and how school is going (for me since I’m the only one still studies). 
                <br><br>
                This is even a busier hour for me because the interior designers usually finished some markups and floor plans by now and would tell me to drop them in the design manual, maybe delete some arrows and crop it to show the plans only, no legend or title block shown etc. I know I’ve been talking a lot about this boring thing but that’s all for 11 am.

              If I were to be in class right now, this would be when we have one on one consultation with the teacher. I always start this by showing the teacher three concepts and ask them for their opinions then help me choose which ons is the strongest, or which part from each concept is the strongest then combine together. 
                <br><br>
                Someone once told me if the class is entirely about consultation then just show up at the last two hours or the last hour even because, that’s when the teacher finished talking to most students and you can just get right into your business, no waiting, and more time to sleep. No need to hear from that, I already did that trick a few times and I was surprised how a four-hour class can sum up in 12 minutes and still answer all the questions I need to ask.

              This is officially my lunchtime, both at work and at school. This is also my brunch time if I don’t have to get up early that day. This is yet another favorite time of the day when I get to meet my close friends and spill the T. That means gossiping and sometimes shading other people by saying the T - the truth (drag queen lingo) but mainly, the conversation revolves around us like our studies, people we hate but we have to face everyday, or just discussing skincare. 
                <br><br>
                My friends live next to the Melbourne Central Station so it’s pretty where I work but they always choose a diner near their place and makes me walk 700 metres there when I only have an hour for lunch break. How can they expect to walk back on time? It may sound serious with this workplace I’ve been telling you about but I often come back 15 minutes late because no one is that much of a cunt to record your break time, as long as you do the job nicely, you’re fine.

                I don’t know if this is just coincidence but it feels like everyone communicates at a scheduled time at work because at around 2, the interior designer sitting from the other end of the office would be walking to me asking about how I’m going and where I’m at so she knows we’re all synchronised and discuss a bit about what we’ll cover the next day or next week. 
                <br><br>
                There are a few times when the project manager would be asking me for my help translating his email to Vietnamese in order to send both the English and Vietnamese version to the client. And all these things happen at 2 pm, never earlier, never later, straight up 2 am. It seems weird, but perhaps this is how they’re used to working and everyday is the same for everyone so eventually, you keep returning to old habits.

              I used to sprint so quickly to Paperpoint around this time last semester because the store is in South Melbourne and it closes at 5:30. I remembered sitting on the train trying to count all the paper I’m supposed to buy for the projects I’m having at the moment, trying to decide whether I should buy some extra paper just in case I mess up some small details. 
                <br><br>
                It’s not even rush hour but the moment you enter the CBD, and especially when you get off the train at Southern Cross Station, the signs of people starts to show and the tram I often catch is the clearest proof of that. It’s only 3 pm and you can definitely tell a lot of people sneak out early from work to go home and that makes 3 pm the official rush hour of Melbourne. Even though I really appreciate the network of public transport in this city, I just wish they build more train lines to places like Saint Kilda or South Melbourne, despite them being small and short in distance, there are not few people work and live there.

              It’s finally choosing paper time. I have been visiting Paperpoint so many times they remember my face and know I’m a student so I was given a piece of paper to write down the paper’s name without even asking and I don’t even need to show them my student card for discount anymore, they just know me so well. Believe it or not I never take less than an hour to pick my paper, an hour and a half to be exact. Even after visiting so many times, I always take the time to see and feel every single stock they have before deciding. 
                <br><br>
                Most of the times I ended up picking Stephen or the Cur Skin paper because they not only feel right but they behave marvelously with printers and laser ink. During this hour, I usually get 3-4 polite “How is it going, do you need any help?” from the staff, andI’m quite surprised everytime they do, though they know I’m way too familiar with this place. But I really appreciate that kind of service.

            <br>
              It’s almost their closing time and I almost finish choosing paper by this time, but that is not it for my day. After the paper store, I still need to go to Dinkums to do some test prints and make sure their printers can deal with my paper, sometimes the texture on paper are too harsh and can make text look inaccurate. 
                <br><br>
                The trip between the two places always frustrates me because this is when people get off from work and the tram I take which runs pass Flinder street and Melbourne Central is always crowded. It is not the kind of crowded when there’s no vacant seat but even worse than that, there are way too many people, you can literally take your feet off the ground and people will carry you with where they’re going. Besides Paperpoint, Dinkums also knows me pretty well.

              I always end up at this very bus stop next on Caulfield campus no matter if it’s a working day, studying day, or shopping day. This is the only hub that gets me from the city center or near-centre suburb back to where I live, Clayton. This is starting to get too familiar when you learn by heart when the buses arrive and depart for almost every hour. 
                <br><br>
                At this very spot, after long days, this is where all my tiresome and frustration come and really make me feel like dying. It’s when you just sit there with a bunch of material and hunger and a pair of dead legs. Sometimes there is even a long line waiting for the bus and not so few times I have to wait for the next bus because the current one is already full and that’s another 30 minutes waiting.

              Home sweet home, here I am. This can be my cooking time, or my heating up food from yesterday time. It’s funny how you always tell yourself what you need to do when you get home so you can meet the deadline of stuff, but the moment you see your bed, it’s all but theory. 
                <br><br>
                7 pm is still pretty early to get things done  but I tend to procrastinate when I get home so this is actually my chilling time when I would be waiting for my food to be cooked in the oven and watching things on YouTube in the meantime. Showering, exfoliating, shaving all taking place at this time, I would also do a quick load of laundry if they run out of clothes for the next day.

              Finally, it’s the grand meal of the day for me. This is when I can enjoy a relaxing time, eating a huge meal slowly while watching a few episodes of TV series or a movie on my laptop and hope this moment lasts forever. Game of Thrones used to be a go to entertainment but it has way too few episodes and basically I have to find something while waiting for it to air again next year.
                <br><br>
                My favorite series includes How To Get Away With Murder, 2 Broke Girls, Stranger Things, Empire, Revenge, a few Chinese soap operas that you may not know, Wendy Williams show etc. I don’t really have a specific type, but anything dramatic and unreal (but with good demonstration that feels like real) would make it on my list.

              And here it is, my official procrastination period. I used to be so so productive during this time months ago, but i guess that was because I didn’t have this job where I had to make 200 pages of design manuals on a daily basis. At some point when your body just can’t force itself to give 200% of its strength anymore, it will rebel and shut down. That’s so me at 9 pm. 
                <br><br>
                I’m pretty much still watching shows, but I’ve moved on to either having desert at this moment, or moisturising my body. That sounds random and weird right, but that’s just me, get used to it. Sometimes I get  phone calls from my parents in Vietnam since it’s 6 pm there and they both finish work and get home by then. They don’t call me everyday and I don’t call them everyday, that just seems too weird and overly protected if we do so.

              Remember me bragging about my craft and packaging stuff every two hour? This is when I do them. Starting by cutting the template or the pages off the printed sheets if I do publications, I automatically get lured into these physical interaction with material. It feels quite healthy and engaging when you can take some time off the computer screen and really get your hands and eyes coordinate to make something taking its real shape. 
                <br><br>
                There is no feeling on earth like when you cut a letterhead out of the printed sheet with extreme precision and you start to appreciate the paper weight and scale, how it sits nicely on the table and how your fingers can feel the texture of paper. However, it is a different story if you have to cut 70 sheets and if they are for binding later because you have to make sure they are absolutely correct, not even by 1 mm smaller or bigger.

            <br>
            <br>
              After cutting the materials to the desired dimension, it is time to put things together. For every packaging I do, I have to make sure they will last for years in case I want to go back to them and take some photos for the folio, that’s why I often use tons of glue and multiple layers of paper to construct really strong and lasting boxes. Sometimes when my design doesn’t stop at printed graphics only but also includes die cuts or difficult shapes such as cylindrical.
                <br><br>
                I have to spend a lot more hours to cut them (duh) and then paste layers on top of layers to form a stable shape. Despite enjoying this whole experience, deep down in my lazy instinct, I still take some breaks to have snack or simply watch another Rupaul’s Drag Race video just to get more motivation. Sometimes I end up spending the entire next hour still watching stuff online though, but who am I to blame when they make the online binge watching experience so trippy.
