        Sometimes being dumb is the only smart alternative. <br>Shy people are secretly egoists. <br>Nothing is real. <br>Everything you see is a dream you project onto the world. <br>Children live out their parents unconscious. <br>The only animals that suffer from anxiety are the ones that associate with humans. <br>I donâ€™t trust people who are very articulate. <br>The only way to be sane is to embrace your sanity. <br>When you feel guilty about being sad, remember Walt Disney was a manic depressive. <br>Everything I said could be totally wrong. </li></a></p>
