            Humans 01 Manifesto
            <br>
            No plan survives first contact with the enemy. Sometimes being dumb is the only smart alternative. Shy people are secretly egoists. Nothing is real. Everything you see is a dream you project onto the world. Children live out their parents unconscious. The only animals that suffer from anxiety are the ones that associate with humans. I don’t trust people who are very articulate. The only way to be sane is to embrace your sanity. When you feel guilty about being sad, remember Walt Disney was a manic depressive. Everything I said could be totally wrong.

            Humans 02 Manifesto
            <br>
            Everything is transient. Everything is a process not an object.

            Humans 03 Manifesto
            <br>
            01 Be more positive.
            <br>
            02 Try to stop anthropomorphizing the animals I know, or at least do it less.
            <br>
            03 Play games that require abandon.
