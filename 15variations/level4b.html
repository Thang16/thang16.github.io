          No plan survives first contact with the enemy. Sometimes being dumb is the only smart alternative. Shy people are secretly egoists. Nothing is real. Everything you see is a dream you project onto the world. Children live out their parents unconscious. The only animals that suffer from anxiety are the ones that associate with humans. I donâ€™t trust people who are very articulate. The only way to be sane is to embrace your sanity. When you feel guilty about being sad, remember Walt Disney was a manic depressive. Everything I said could be totally wrong.

          Everything is transient. Everything is a process not an object.

        <p style="position: relative; left: 900px;">Be more positive.
          <br>
          02 Try to stop anthropomorphizing the animals I know, or at least do it less.
          <br>
          03 Play games that require abandon.
          <br>
          04 Get better at maintaining relationships with friends.
